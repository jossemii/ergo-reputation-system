Our purpose to the Ergohack-VII is reputation system. A reputation system addresses a fundamental need in the blockchain ecosystem - trust. Trust is essential in any ecosystem, and our system aims to bridge the trust gap by providing a decentralized, user-driven mechanism for assigning and transferring reputation.
